# screw-detection
This repository can perform screw detection using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, each with its own dataset. Furthermore, a simple web application was implemented using Streamlit :fire:

- In README.md, located in the yolov5 and yolov8 directories, there are 
step by step instructions on how to train using your own data.
  - [Detection with yolov5](./yolov5/)
  - [Detection with yolov8](./yolov8/)

- The app directory contains instructions on how to run Streamlit.
  - [App with streamlit](./app)

You can use this repository for the following demonstrations.
